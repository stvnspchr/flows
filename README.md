Flows in the Platte River
=====
# About

The Platte River system flows through Nebraska in four segments: the North Platte River, the South Platte River, the Platte River proper, and the Loup Rivers. At various places along the river's journey, the United States Geological Survey, [USGS], (http://usgs.gov) has gauging stations where a variety of river parameters are measured. Discharge, or simply the flow rate, is perhaps the most indicative of the current state of the stream. Measured in cubic feet per second, flow rates can tell us how much water is in the river at any given time.
